### Hosting, callbacks, ES6 features

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase in other words we can access variables or functions even before initializing it or even before putting value in it.

example:

```
console.log(x)
var x = 10;
```
